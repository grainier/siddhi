## 📊 Milestone 10: Incremental Aggregations (v1.0)

**Timeline**: Q3 2027 (12-14 weeks)
**Theme**: "Time-Series Analytics at Scale"
**Status**: 📋 Planned

### Goals
Implement enterprise-grade incremental aggregation framework for efficient time-series analytics with multi-duration aggregations and historical data integration.

### Key Features

#### 1. Multi-Duration Aggregation
- 🆕 **AggregationRuntime**: Manage time-based aggregation hierarchy
- 🆕 **Auto-Granularity**: Automatic second/minute/hour/day/month aggregations
- 🆕 **Aggregation Cascading**: Roll-up from fine to coarse granularity

```sql
-- Multi-duration aggregation definition
CREATE AGGREGATION SalesAggregation
WITH (
    by = 'timestamp',
    granularity = 'second'
) AS
SELECT
    region,
    SUM(amount) as total_sales,
    AVG(amount) as avg_sale,
    COUNT(*) as sale_count
FROM SalesStream
GROUP BY region;

-- Query at any granularity
SELECT * FROM SalesAggregation
WITHIN last '30 days'
PER 'hour'
WHERE region == 'US-WEST';
```

#### 2. Incremental Computation
- 🆕 **IncrementalExecutor**: Streaming aggregation updates
- 🆕 **IncrementalAggregator**: Delta-based computation
- 🆕 **Optimization**: Avoid recomputing entire aggregations

#### 3. Historical Data Integration
- 🆕 **BaseIncrementalValueStore**: Persistent aggregation storage
- 🆕 **Batch-Stream Unification**: Merge historical and streaming data
- 🆕 **Backfill Support**: Reprocess historical data into aggregations

#### 4. Persisted Aggregations
- 🆕 **Database Backend**: Store aggregations in PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- 🆕 **Retention Policies**: Automatic aggregation pruning
- 🆕 **Compaction**: Merge old aggregations for efficiency

#### 5. Distributed Aggregations
- 🆕 **Cross-Node Aggregation**: Coordinate aggregations across cluster
- 🆕 **Partial Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple nodes
- 🆕 **Aggregation Routing**: Direct data to correct aggregation node

### Example Usage

```sql
-- Time-series analytics across multiple granularities
CREATE AGGREGATION TrafficMetrics
WITH (
    by = 'timestamp',
    granularity = 'second',
    retention = '90 days'
) AS
SELECT
    endpoint,
    COUNT(*) as request_count,
    AVG(responseTime) as avg_response_time,
    PERCENTILE(responseTime, 95) as p95_latency
FROM APIRequestStream
GROUP BY endpoint;

-- Query hourly metrics for last week
SELECT
    endpoint,
    SUM(request_count) as total_requests,
    AVG(avg_response_time) as avg_latency
FROM TrafficMetrics
WITHIN last '7 days'
PER 'hour';

-- Query daily rollup for last quarter
SELECT
    DATE(timestamp) as day,
    endpoint,
    SUM(request_count) as daily_requests
FROM TrafficMetrics
WITHIN last '90 days'
PER 'day'
ORDER BY day, daily_requests DESC;
```

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Aggregation Update | <1ms | Per incoming event |
| Multi-Duration Storage | 90%+ reduction | vs storing all granularities separately |
| Query Latency | <10ms | For aggregated data retrieval |
| Historical Backfill | 1M events/sec | Reprocessing speed |

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent aggregations
- [ ] Multi-duration queries respond in <10ms
- [ ] Handle TB+ of historical aggregation data
- [ ] Automatic granularity selection based on query
- [ ] Distributed aggregation across 10+ nodes
- [ ] Comprehensive time-series analytics examples

### Migration Impact
- Major feature addition for analytics workloads
- Existing aggregations continue to work (non-incremental)
- Opt-in to incremental aggregation framework
- Automatic migration tools for existing aggregations
