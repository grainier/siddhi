## Development Guidelines

### Performance-First Approach

1. **Benchmark Everything**: Create benchmarks before optimization
2. **Profile First**: Use `perf`, `flamegraph` before optimizing
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Prefer stack allocation, minimize heap usage
4. **Lock-Free When Possible**: Use crossbeam, avoid mutex in hot paths

### Adding Core Components

#### High-Performance Component Template
```rust
pub struct HighPerfProcessor {
    // Use lock-free structures
    ring_buffer: crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue<Event>,
    // Pre-allocate memory
    event_pool: ObjectPool<Event>,
    // Atomic counters for metrics
    processed: AtomicU64,
}
```

#### Distributed Component Template
```rust
pub struct DistributedProcessor {
    // Cluster state
    cluster: Arc<ClusterCoordinator>,
    // Node identity
    node_id: NodeId,
    // Distributed state
    state: Arc<DistributedState>,
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Test individual components
```rust
#[test]
fn test_ring_buffer_throughput() {
    // Benchmark >1M events/second
}
```

**Integration Tests**: Use `AppRunner` helper
```rust
let runner = AppRunner::new(app, "Out");
runner.send("In", vec![...]);
assert_eq!(runner.shutdown(), expected);
```

**Distributed Tests**: Test cluster scenarios
```rust
#[test]
fn test_failover() {
    let cluster = TestCluster::new(3);
    cluster.kill_node(0);
    assert!(cluster.is_healthy());
}
```

## Performance Targets

### Single-Node Performance

- **CPU**: Linear scaling with cores

### Distributed Performance

- **Failover Time**: <5 seconds
- **State Recovery**: <30 seconds
- **Network Overhead**: <10% throughput impact

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a Window Processor
```rust
// 1. Create in src/core/query/processor/stream/window/
pub struct MyWindowProcessor {
    meta: CommonProcessorMeta,
    // Use efficient data structures
    buffer: VecDeque<Arc<StreamEvent>>,
}

// 2. Implement WindowProcessor trait
impl WindowProcessor for MyWindowProcessor {}

// 3. Add to factory in mod.rs
"myWindow" => Ok(Arc::new(Mutex::new(
    MyWindowProcessor::from_handler(handler, app_ctx, query_ctx)?
))),

// 4. Create comprehensive tests
#[test]
fn test_my_window() {
    // Test functionality and performance
}
```

## StateHolder Compression & Serialization Issues Resolved (2025-08-11)

### ✅ **StateHolder Compression Migration COMPLETED**

**Original Issue (2025-08-09)**: All existing StateHolders (11/12) had placeholder compression implementations with debug messages

**Resolution Completed (2025-08-11)**:
- ✅ **Shared Compression Utility Created** (`src/core/util/compression.rs`)
- ✅ **All StateHolders Migrated** to use `CompressibleStateHolder` trait
- ✅ **Full Algorithm Support**: LZ4, Snappy, Zstd with intelligent selection
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All debug statements removed, proper error handling
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: All compression tests passing with real compression

**Critical Serialization Bugs Fixed**:

1. **Lock Contention/Deadlock Issues**:
   - **Root Cause**: Multiple blocking lock acquisitions in `serialize_state()` chain
   - **Impact**: Tests were hanging indefinitely during serialization
   - **Fix Applied**: Replaced `lock().unwrap()` with `try_lock()` patterns
   - **Files Fixed**: 
     - `SessionWindowStateHolder::estimate_size()` - Non-blocking lock with fallback
     - `SessionWindowStateHolder::component_metadata()` - Safe lock handling
     - `LengthWindowStateHolder::serialize_state()` - Early lock release pattern
     - `LengthWindowStateHolder::estimate_size()` - Non-blocking implementation

2. **Compression Type Handling**:
   - **Issue**: `CompressionType::None` not properly handled early in pipeline
   - **Fix**: Added early return for explicit `None` requests in `compress_state_data()`
   - **Location**: `src/core/util/compression.rs` line 626-628

3. **Test Reliability**:
   - **Previously**: 6 tests with `#[ignore]` due to hanging
   - **Now**: All tests enabled and passing
   - **Compression Effectiveness**: 90-95% space savings on real data

**Performance Metrics Achieved**:
```
Uncompressed: 6,330 bytes
LZ4: 629 bytes (9.9% of original) - 90.1% reduction
Snappy: 599 bytes (9.5% of original) - 90.5% reduction
Zstd: 274 bytes (4.3% of original) - 95.7% reduction
```

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ **SessionWindowStateHolder** - Full implementation with all tests passing
- ✅ **LengthWindowStateHolder** - Migrated with serialization fixes
- ✅ **TimeWindowStateHolder** - Using shared compression utility
- ✅ **LengthBatchWindowStateHolder** - Using shared compression utility
- ✅ **TimeBatchWindowStateHolder** - Using shared compression utility
- ✅ **ExternalTimeWindowStateHolder** - Using shared compression utility
- ✅ **All AggregatorStateHolders** (6 types) - Using shared compression utility

**Key Architecture Improvements**:
- **CompressibleStateHolder Trait**: Provides default compression implementation
- **OptimizedCompressionEngine**: Thread-safe global compression engine
- **Intelligent Algorithm Selection**: Based on data characteristics and size
- **Lock-Free Design**: Non-blocking patterns prevent deadlocks
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: When compression provides no benefit
